# Football Akinator Game

## Project Overview

This project implements a Football Akinator Game, an interactive guessing game inspired by the classic Akinator concept. Instead of general trivia, the system attempts to guess the football player the user is thinking of by asking a series of yes/no questions.

The project uses a structured knowledge base of football players and their attributes, along with a decision-based questioning system that narrows down the possibilities with each response. As the user answers, the game intelligently filters players and ultimately makes a final guess.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how decision trees, attribute-based filtering, and logical inference can be applied to create a simple, engaging AI-driven guessing experience. It also showcases interactive program flow, user input handling, and game logic design.

## Technologies Used

• Python – Main programming language used to develop the game logic and interactive interface.<br>

• Decision Tree / Rule-Based Logic – For narrowing down possible football players based on user responses.<br>

• Custom Knowledge Base – A structured collection of football players and attributes used for reasoning.<br>

• Command-Line Interface (CLI) – For interactive question-and-answer gameplay.<br>
